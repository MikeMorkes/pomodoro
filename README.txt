Free Code Camp Pomodoro Clock Challenge

This FCC challenge was building a working Pomodoro Clock with the ability to adjust timer length. I also programmed it to work with the clientâ€™s system clock, rather than using the JavaScript setTimeout() method, which can be inaccurate.
Built with HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Animate.css, Bootstrap, and jQuery
